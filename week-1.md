# Week 1 Exercises
The following exercises are to be completed after you finish the first 4 modules of the Treehouse course and do the required reading. Feel free to your answers anywhere you see fit. In our next session, we're learn how to use the console and start writing JavaScript in files.

## Exercise 1
Write some code to reverse a string. For example, the string:

```js
'hello'
```

Should log:

```js
'olleh'
```

## Exercise 2
Create a program that console logs the following sentence:

'If you convert 98 degrees fahrenheit to kelvin, it's 310.'

Start with the following code:

```js
var fahrenheit = 98;
var kelvin = // write your code here;

console.log(// write your code here);
```

Note, decimals are fine, but as a challenge try and round to the nearest whole number.

## Exercise 3
If the first two human years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each, and each human year following counts as 4 dog years, how old are you in dog years? Use JavaScript variables and operators to write some code to figure it out.
