# Week 1 Exercises
The following exercises are to be completed after you finish the first 4 modules of the Pluralsight course and do the required reading. Feel free to your answers anywhere you see fit. In our next session, we're learn how to use the console and start writing JavaScript in files.

## Exercise 1
Write some code to reverse a string. For example, the string:

```js
'hello'
```

Sh2ould log:

```js
'olleh'
```

## Exercise 2
What will the following code log to the console?

```j
console.log(fullName);
var firstName = 'Jimmy';
var fullName = firstName + lastName;
var lastName = 'Hendrix';
```

## Exercise 3
Create a program that console logs the following sentence:

'If you convert 98 degrees fahrenheit to kelvin, it's 305.'

Start with the following code:

```js
var fahrenheit = 98;
var kelvin = // write your code here;

console.log(// write your code here);
```

Note, decimals are fine, but as a challenge try and round to the nearest whole number.

## Exercise 4
If the first two human years of a dog's life count as 10.5 dog years each, and each human year following counts as 4 dog years, how old are you in dog years? Use JavaScript variables and operators to write some code to figure it out.

## Exercise 5
The following code loops through the number 1 to 20. Inside the "for loop" (the brackets) write some code that console logs 'Fizz' if the number is divisble by 3, 'Buzz' if it's divisble by 5 and "FizzBuzz" if it's divisible by 3 and 5. Otherwise, console log the number.

```js
for (var i = 1; i < 20; i++) {
// write your code here
}
```
